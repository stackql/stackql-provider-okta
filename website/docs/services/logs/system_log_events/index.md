<table>
<thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Datatype</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td><CopyableCode code="actor" /></td>
    <td><code>object</code></td>
    <td>Describes the user, app, client, or other entity (actor) who performs an action on a target. The actor is dependent on the action that is performed. All events have actors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><CopyableCode code="authenticationContext" /></td>
    <td><code>object</code></td>
    <td>All authentication relies on validating one or more credentials that prove the authenticity of the actor's identity. Credentials are sometimes provided by the actor, as is the case with passwords, and at other times provided by a third party, and validated by the authentication provider.  The authenticationContext contains metadata about how the actor is authenticated. For example, an authenticationContext for an event, where a user authenticates with Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA), looks like the following: ``` &#123;     "authenticationProvider": "ACTIVE_DIRECTORY",     "authenticationStep": 0,     "credentialProvider": null,     "credentialType": "IWA",     "externalSessionId": "102N1EKyPFERROGvK9wizMAPQ",     "interface": null,     "issuer": null &#125; ``` In this case, the user enters an IWA credential to authenticate against an Active Directory instance. All of the user's future-generated events in this sign-in session are going to share the same `externalSessionId`.  Among other operations, this response object can be used to scan for suspicious sign-in activity or perform analytics on user authentication habits (for example, how often authentication scheme X is used versus authentication scheme Y).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><CopyableCode code="client" /></td>
    <td><code>object</code></td>
    <td>When an event is triggered by an HTTP request, the `client` object describes the [client](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616) that issues the HTTP request. For instance, the web browser is the client when a user accesses Okta. When this request is received and processed, a sign-in event is fired. When the event isn't sourced to an HTTP request, such as an automatic update, the `client` object field is blank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><CopyableCode code="debugContext" /></td>
    <td><code>object</code></td>
    <td>For some kinds of events (for example, OLM provisioning, sign-in request, second factor SMS, and so on), the fields that are provided in other response objects aren't sufficient to adequately describe the operations that the event has performed. In such cases, the `debugContext` object provides a way to store additional information.  For example, an event where a second factor SMS token is sent to a user may have a `debugContext` that looks like the following: ``` &#123;     "debugData": &#123;         "requestUri": "/api/v1/users/00u3gjksoiRGRAZHLSYV/factors/smsf8luacpZJAva10x45/verify",         "smsProvider": "TELESIGN",         "transactionId": "268632458E3C100F5F5F594C6DC689D4"     &#125; &#125; ``` By inspecting the debugData field, you can find the URI that is used to trigger the second factor SMS (`/api/v1/users/00u3gjksoiRGRAZHLSYV/factors/smsf8luacpZJAva10x45/verify`), the SMS provider (`TELESIGN`), and the ID used by Telesign to identify this transaction (`268632458E3C100F5F5F594C6DC689D4`).  If for some reason the information that is needed to implement a feature isn't provided in other response objects, you should scan the `debugContext.debugData` field for potentially useful fields. &gt; **Important:** The information contained in `debugContext.debugData` is intended to add context when troubleshooting customer platform issues. Both key names and values may change from release to release and aren't guaranteed to be stable. Therefore, they shouldn't be viewed as a data contract but as a debugging aid instead.</td>

<tr>
    <td><CopyableCode code="displayMessage" /></td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
    <td>The display message for an event</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><CopyableCode code="eventType" /></td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
    <td>The published event type. Event instances are categorized by action in the event type attribute. This attribute is key to navigating the System Log through expression filters. See [Event Types catalog](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/event-types/#catalog) for a complete list of System Log event types.</td>

<tr>
    <td><CopyableCode code="request" /></td>
    <td><code>object</code></td>
    <td>The `Request` object describes details that are related to the HTTP request that triggers this event, if available. When the event isn't sourced to an HTTP request, such as an automatic update on the Okta servers, the `Request` object still exists, but the `ipChain` field is empty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><CopyableCode code="securityContext" /></td>
    <td><code>object</code></td>
    <td>The `securityContext` object provides security information that is directly related to the evaluation of the event's IP reputation. IP reputation is a trustworthiness rating that evaluates how likely a sender is to be malicious and is based on the sender's IP address. As the name implies, the `securityContext` object is useful for security applications-flagging and inspecting suspicious events.</td>

<tr>
    <td><CopyableCode code="severity" /></td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
    <td>Indicates how severe the event is</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><CopyableCode code="target" /></td>
    <td><code>array</code></td>
    <td>The entity that an actor performs an action on. Targets can be anything, such as an app user, a sign-in token, or anything else.  &gt; **Note:** When searching the target array, search for a given `type` rather than the array location. Target types, such as `User` and `AppInstance`,  for a given `eventType` are not always in the same array location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><CopyableCode code="transaction" /></td>
    <td><code>object</code></td>
    <td>A `transaction` object comprises contextual information associated with its respective event.  This information is useful for understanding sequences of correlated events. For example, a `transaction` object such as the following: ``` &#123;   "id": "Wn4f-0RQ8D8lTSLkAmkKdQAADqo",   "type": "WEB",   "detail": null &#125; ``` indicates that a `WEB` request with `id` `Wn4f-0RQ8D8lTSLkAmkKdQAADqo` has created this event.  A `transaction` object with a `requestApiTokenId` in the `detail` object, for example : ``` &#123;   "id": "YjSlblAAqnKY7CdyCkXNBgAAAIU",   "type": "WEB",   "detail": &#123;     "requestApiTokenId": "00T94e3cn9kSEO3c51s5"   &#125; &#125; ``` indicates that this event was the result of an action performed through an API using the token identified by 00T94e3cn9kSEO3c51s5. The token ID is visible in the Admin Console, **Security** &gt; **API**. See [API token management](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=Security_API). For more information on API tokens, see [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/).</td>
