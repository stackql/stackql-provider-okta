    <td>Retrieves a user from your Okta org.<br /><br />You can substitute `me` for the `id` to fetch the current user linked to an API token or session cookie.<br /> * The request returns the user linked to the API token that is specified in the Authorization header, not the user linked to the active session. Details of the admin user who granted the API token is returned.<br /> * When the end user has an active Okta session, it is typically a CORS request from the browser. Therefore, it's possible to retrieve the current user without the Authorization header.<br /><br />When fetching a user by `login` or `login shortname`, [URL encode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding) the request parameter to ensure that special characters are escaped properly. Logins with a `/` character can only be fetched by `id` due to URL issues with escaping the `/` character. If you don't know a user's ID, you can use the [List all users](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers) endpoint to find it.<br /><br />&gt; **Note:** Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, which disrupts Okta functionality in certain flows.

The system performs group reconciliation during activation and assigns the user to all apps via direct or indirect relationships (group memberships).<br />* The user's `transitioningToStatus` property is `ACTIVE` during activation to indicate that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.<br />* The user's `status` is `ACTIVE` when the activation process is complete.<br /><br />The user is emailed a one-time activation token if activated without a password.<br /><br />&gt; **Note:** If the user is assigned to an app that is configured for provisioning, the activation process triggers downstream provisioning to the app.  It is possible for a user to sign in before these apps have been successfully provisioned for the user.<br /><br />&gt; **Important:** Do not generate or send a one-time activation token when activating users with an assigned password. Users should sign in with their assigned password.<br /><br />For more information about the various scenarios of creating a user listed in the examples, see the [User creation scenarios](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#user-creation-scenarios) section.</td>

For example, `filter=lastUpdated gt "2013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"` is encoded as `filter=lastUpdated%20gt%20%222013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z%22`. Filtering is case-sensitive for property names and query values, while operators are case-insensitive.  Filtering supports the following limited number of properties: `status`, `lastUpdated`, `id`, `profile.login`, `profile.email`, `profile.firstName`, and `profile.lastName`.  Additionally, filtering supports only the equal `eq` operator from the standard Okta API filtering semantics, except in the case of the `lastUpdated` property. This property can also use the inequality operators (`gt`, `ge`, `lt`, and `le`). For logical operators, only the logical operators `and` and `or` are supported. The `not` operator isn't supported.

Use the `q` parameter for simple queries, such as a lookup of users by name when creating a people picker.  The value of `q` is matched against `firstName`, `lastName`, or `email`. This performs a `startsWith` match, but this is an implementation detail and can change without notice. You don't need to specify `firstName`, `lastName`, or `email`.  &gt; **Note:** Using the `q` parameter in a request omits users that have a status of `DEPROVISIONED`.

<tr id="parameter-search">
    <td><CopyableCode code="search" /></td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
    <td>Searches for users with a supported filtering expression for most properties. Okta recommends using this parameter for optimal search performance.   &gt; **Note:** Using an overly complex or long search query can result in an error.  This operation supports [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination). Use an ID lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data. Returned users include those with the `DEPROVISIONED` status.  Property names in the search parameter are case sensitive, whereas operators (`eq`, `sw`, and so on) and string values are case insensitive. Unlike with user logins, diacritical marks are significant in search string values: a search for `isaac.brock` finds `Isaac.Brock`, but doesn't find a property whose value is `isáàc.bröck`.   This operation requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). For example, `search=profile.department eq "Engineering"` is encoded as `search=profile.department%20eq%20%22Engineering%22`. If you use the special character `"` within a quoted string, it must also be escaped `\` and encoded. For example, `search=profile.lastName eq "bob"smith"` is encoded as `search=profile.lastName%20eq%20%22bob%5C%22smith%22`. See [Special Characters](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#special-characters).  This operation searches many properties:   * Any user profile attribute, including custom-defined attributes   * The top-level properties: `id`, `status`, `created`, `activated`, `statusChanged`, and `lastUpdated`   * The [user type](https://developer.okta.com/docs/apihttps://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/#tag/UserType/operation/updateUserType) accessed as `type.id`  &gt; **Note:** &lt;x-lifecycle class="ea"&gt;&lt;/x-lifecycle&gt; The ability to search by user classification is available as an [Early Access](https://developer.okta.com/docs/apihttps://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature. The `classification.type` property cannot be used in conjunction with other search terms. You can search using `classification.type eq "LITE"` or `classification.type eq "STANDARD"`.  You can also use `sortBy` and `sortOrder` parameters. The `ne` (not equal) operator isn't supported, but you can obtain the same result by using `lt ... or ... gt`. For example, to see all users except those that have a status of `STAGED`, use `(status lt "STAGED" or status gt "STAGED")`.  You can search properties that are arrays. If any element matches the search term, the entire array (object) is returned. Okta follows the [SCIM Protocol Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2) for searching arrays. You can search multiple arrays, multiple values in an array, as well as using the standard logical and filtering operators. See [Filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#filter).  Searches for users can be filtered by the following operators: `sw`, `eq`, and `co`. You can only use `co` with these select user profile attributes: `profile.firstName`, `profile.lastName`, `profile.email`, and `profile.login`. See [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators).</td>

<TabItem value="get_user">

Retrieves a user from your Okta org.<br /><br />You can substitute `me` for the `id` to fetch the current user linked to an API token or session cookie.<br /> * The request returns the user linked to the API token that is specified in the Authorization header, not the user linked to the active session. Details of the admin user who granted the API token is returned.<br /> * When the end user has an active Okta session, it is typically a CORS request from the browser. Therefore, it's possible to retrieve the current user without the Authorization header.<br /><br />When fetching a user by `login` or `login shortname`, [URL encode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding) the request parameter to ensure that special characters are escaped properly. Logins with a `/` character can only be fetched by `id` due to URL issues with escaping the `/` character. If you don't know a user's ID, you can use the [List all users](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers) endpoint to find it.<br /><br />&gt; **Note:** Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, which disrupts Okta functionality in certain flows.

Creates a new user in your Okta org with or without credentials.<br /><br />&gt; **Legal Disclaimer**<br />&gt;<br />&gt; After a user is added to the Okta directory, they receive an activation email. As part of signing up for this service,<br />&gt; you agreed not to use Okta's service/product to spam and/or send unsolicited messages.<br />&gt; Please refrain from adding unrelated accounts to the directory as Okta is not responsible for, and disclaims any and all<br />&gt; liability associated with, the activation email's content. You, and you alone, bear responsibility for the emails sent to any recipients.<br /><br />All responses return the created user. Activation of a user is an asynchronous operation. The system performs group reconciliation during activation and assigns the user to all apps via direct or indirect relationships (group memberships).<br />* The user's `transitioningToStatus` property is `ACTIVE` during activation to indicate that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.<br />* The user's `status` is `ACTIVE` when the activation process is complete.<br /><br />The user is emailed a one-time activation token if activated without a password.<br /><br />&gt; **Note:** If the user is assigned to an app that is configured for provisioning, the activation process triggers downstream provisioning to the app.  It is possible for a user to sign in before these apps have been successfully provisioned for the user.<br /><br />&gt; **Important:** Do not generate or send a one-time activation token when activating users with an assigned password. Users should sign in with their assigned password.<br /><br />For more information about the various scenarios of creating a user listed in the examples, see the [User creation scenarios](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#user-creation-scenarios) section.

The default user profile is based on the [System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Core Schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643).

The only permitted customizations of the default profile are to update permissions, change whether the `firstName` and `lastName` properties are nullable, and specify a [pattern](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/schemas/#login-pattern-validation) for `login`. You can use the Profile Editor in the Admin Console or the [Schemas API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/apihttps://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UISchema/#tag/UISchema) to make schema modifications.

You can extend user profiles with custom properties. You must first add the custom property to the user profile schema before you reference it.
You can use the Profile Editor in the Admin Console or the [Schemas API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/apihttps://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UISchema/#tag/UISchema) to manage schema extensions.

Custom attributes can contain HTML tags. It's the client's responsibility to escape or encode this data before displaying it. Use [best-practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) to prevent cross-site scripting.

## `UPDATE` examples

    ]}
>
<TabItem value="update_user">

Updates a user's profile or credentials with partial update semantics.<br /><br />&gt; **Important:** Use the `POST` method for partial updates. Unspecified properties are set to null with `PUT`.<br /><br />`profile` and `credentials` can be updated independently or together with a single request.<br />&gt; **Note**: Currently, the user type of a user can only be changed via a full replacement PUT operation. If the request parameters of a partial update include the type element from the user object,<br />the value must match the existing type of the user. Only admins are permitted to change the user type of a user; end users are not allowed to change their own user type.<br /><br />&gt; **Note**: To update a current user's profile with partial semantics, the `/api/v1/users/me` endpoint can be invoked.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; A user can only update profile properties for which the user has write access. Within the profile, if the user tries to update the primary or the secondary email IDs, verification emails are sent to those email IDs, and the fields are updated only upon verification.<br /><br />If you are using this endpoint to set a password, it sets a password without validating existing user credentials. This is an administrative operation. For operations that validate credentials, refer to the [Reset password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/apihttps://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/resetPassword), [Start forgot password flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/apihttps://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/forgotPassword), and [Update password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/apihttps://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/changePassword) endpoints.

<TabItem value="delete_user">

Deletes a user permanently. This operation can only be performed on users that have a `DEPROVISIONED` status.<br /><br />&gt; **Warning:** This action can't be recovered!<br /><br />This operation on a user that hasn't been deactivated causes that user to be deactivated. A second delete operation is required to delete the user.<br /><br />&gt; **Note:** You can also perform user deletion asynchronously. To invoke asynchronous user deletion, pass an HTTP header `Prefer: respond-async` with the request.<br /><br />This header is also supported by user deactivation, which is performed if the delete endpoint is invoked on a user that hasn't been deactivated.

<TabItem value="end_user_sessions">

Ends Okta sessions for the currently signed in user. By default, the current session remains active. Use this method in a browser-based app.<br />&gt; **Note:** This operation requires a session cookie for the user. The API token isn't allowed for this operation.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="activate_user">

Activates a user.<br /><br />Perform this operation only on users with a `STAGED` or `DEPROVISIONED` status. Activation of a user is an asynchronous operation.<br />* The user has the `transitioningToStatus` property with an `ACTIVE` value during activation. This indicates that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.<br />* The user has an `ACTIVE` status when the activation process completes.<br /><br />Users who don't have a password must complete the welcome flow by visiting the activation link to complete the transition to `ACTIVE` status.<br /><br />&gt; **Note:** If you want to send a branded user activation email, change the subdomain of your request to the custom domain that's associated with the brand.<br />&gt; For example, change `subdomain.okta.com` to `custom.domain.one`. See [Multibrand and custom domains](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/brands/#multibrand-and-custom-domains).<br /><br />&gt; **Note:** If you have optional password enabled, visiting the activation link is optional for users who aren't required to enroll a password.<br />&gt; See [Create user with optional password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#create-user-with-optional-password).<br /><br />&gt; **Legal disclaimer**<br />&gt; After a user is added to the Okta directory, they receive an activation email. As part of signing up for this service,<br />&gt; you agreed not to use Okta's service/product to spam and/or send unsolicited messages.<br />&gt; Please refrain from adding unrelated accounts to the directory as Okta is not responsible for, and disclaims any and all<br />&gt; liability associated with, the activation email's content. You, and you alone, bear responsibility for the emails sent to any recipients.

```sql
EXEC okta.users.users.activate_user

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="deactivate_user">

Deactivates a user.<br /><br />Perform this operation only on users that do not have a `DEPROVISIONED` status.<br />* The user's `transitioningToStatus` property is `DEPROVISIONED` during deactivation to indicate that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.<br />* The user's status is `DEPROVISIONED` when the deactivation process is complete.<br /><br />&gt; **Important:** Deactivating a user is a **destructive** operation. The user is deprovisioned from all assigned apps, which might destroy their data such as email or files.<br />**This action cannot be recovered!**<br /><br />You can also perform user deactivation asynchronously. To invoke asynchronous user deactivation, pass an HTTP header `Prefer: respond-async` with the request.

```sql

<TabItem value="expire_password">

Expires the password. This operation transitions the user status to `PASSWORD_EXPIRED` so that the user must change their password the next time that they sign in.<br /><br /><br />If you have integrated Okta with your on-premises Active Directory (AD), then setting a user's password as expired in Okta also expires the password in AD.<br />When the user tries to sign in to Okta, delegated authentication finds the password-expired status in AD,<br />and the user is presented with the password-expired page where they can change their password.<br /><br />&gt; **Note:** The Okta account management policy doesn't support the `/users/&#123;id&#125;/lifecycle/expire_password` endpoint. See [Configure an Okta account management policy](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/okta-account-management-policy/main/).

```sql
EXEC okta.users.users.expire_password 
@subdomain='{{ subdomain }}' --required
;
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="expire_password_with_temp_password">

Expires the password and resets the user's password to a temporary password. This operation transitions the user status to `PASSWORD_EXPIRED` so that the user must change their password the next time that they sign in.<br />The user's password is reset to a temporary password that's returned, and then the user's password is expired.<br />If `revokeSessions` is included in the request with a value of `true`, the user's current outstanding sessions are revoked and require re-authentication.<br /><br /><br />If you have integrated Okta with your on-premises Active Directory (AD), then setting a user's password as expired in Okta also expires the password in AD.<br />When the user tries to sign in to Okta, delegated authentication finds the password-expired status in AD,<br />and the user is presented with the password-expired page where they can change their password.

<TabItem value="reset_password">

Resets a password. Generates a one-time token (OTT) that you can use to reset a user's password. You can automatically email the OTT link to the user or return the OTT to the API caller and distribute using a custom flow.<br /><br />This operation transitions the user to the `RECOVERY` status. The user is then not able to sign in or initiate a forgot password flow until they complete the reset flow.<br /><br />This operation provides an option to delete all the user's sessions. However, if the request is made in the context of a session owned by the specified user, that session isn't cleared.<br />&gt; **Note:** You can also use this API to convert a user with the Okta credential provider to use a federated provider. After this conversion, the user can't directly sign in with a password.<br />&gt; To convert a federated user back to an Okta user, use the default API call.<br /><br />If an email address is associated with multiple users, keep in mind the following to ensure a successful password recovery lookup:<br />  * Okta no longer includes deactivated users in the lookup.<br />  * The lookup searches sign-in IDs first, then primary email addresses, and then secondary email addresses.<br />  If `sendEmail` is `false`, returns a link for the user to reset their password.
